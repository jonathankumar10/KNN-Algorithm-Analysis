# KNN_Algorithm

This was an assignment for 2208-CSE-6363-004-MACHINE LEARNING at UTA.

Implemented KNN Algorithm from scratch in python.

This algorithm was used on Iris Dataset, Hayes-Roth Dataset ,Breast Cancer Dataset and Car Evaluation Dataset.
Data was preprocessed according to the dataset and then sent into the algorithm to get the respective results.
Numpy, Pandas, Random and Math library was used as helper libraries.

Achieved a mean accuracy of 95.33% for Iris Dataset, Achieved a mean accuracy of  52.308% for Hayes-Roth Dataset, Achieved a mean accuracy of 65.756% for Car Evaluation Dataset, Achieved a mean accuracy of 67.857% for Breast Cancer Dataset.
We also compared our accuracy obtained from our model with KNN from Weka
